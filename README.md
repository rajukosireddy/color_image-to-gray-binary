# color_image-to-gray-binary
This Python script showcases basic image processing techniques using the OpenCV library. It reads an input color image, converts it to grayscale, applies binary thresholding, and displays the results. The script serves as a practical example for those interested in understanding simple image manipulation with OpenCV.

## Features:
1. Color Image Display: Visualize the original color image.
2. Grayscale Conversion: Convert the color image to grayscale for further analysis.
3. Binary Thresholding: Apply binary thresholding to segment the grayscale image.
4. User-friendly: Easy-to-understand code structure, suitable for beginners in image processing.

## Dependencies:
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
1. Python
2. OpenCV

## Acknowledgments:
1. OpenCV community for the powerful image processing library.
2. Google Colab for providing a convenient environment for running Python scripts.

## Code Explanation:

The code is divided into the following sections:
### I. Importing required libraries
- `cv2`: OpenCV library for computer vision and image processing.
- `cv2_imshow`: A function provided by Google Colab to display images.
  ```bash
  import cv2
  from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
  ```
- Read a color image from the file '1704113778755.png' using cv2.imread().
- The cv2.IMREAD_COLOR flag indicates that the image should be loaded in color.
